title: Tech Gear Casualties of Our Dog
---
Our dog is now about 7 months old. She is a [Lapponian Herder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapponian_Herder), which means she is stubborn and energic. Sometimes it makes a lovely combination, and sometimes it does not.

## Here is a list of what she has obliterated so far:
- Two Ikea night lamps
- Extension cord chewed into multiple pieces (it was plugged in during the obliteration)
- A laptop charger (it also was plugged in during the act of destruction, sparks just few out of her mouth but she did not get any electric shocks)
- Arm of spectacles (This happened in about 10 seconds while I was doing some stuff right next to her)
- Koss PortaPro headphones (I have to figure out how I'm going to listen all the good podcasts by [5by5.tv](http://www.5by5.tv) and [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com))
- Some shoes (The usual)

I'm writing this blog post just because I need get something online and hopefully gain some inspiration to finish my drafts. I don't know, maybe this works, maybe it doesn't. If this will be my one and only blog post, then it definitely did not work. The number of drafts is increasing but number of published blog posts is not. You have to start somewhere, and this is my start.
