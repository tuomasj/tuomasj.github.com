This is my only New Year's resolution.
I will build a side project that generates monthly recurring income.
I try to write blog posts each week describing how I am doing and what I have learned.

<div class="sideprojects-list">
  <h2>Here Are My Blog Posts So Far</h2>
  <hr>
  <ul>
{% for item in site.tags.sideproject2013 %}
  <li><small>{{ item.date || date_to_string }}</small><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
</div>
## What I Really Want to Learn is Internet Marketing ##

I have been programming since I was a kid. I have done web development since late 90's. I have all technical skills to build a web product.

What I want to learn is Internet Marketing. I know lots about it. I have read lots of blog posts and books about the subject, but it's all theoretical information.
I need to start doing it so I actually learn about it.

To get recurring income, I need to build a solution that solves a problem for someone. The solution must be good enough so I can ask money for it.
But I need people to know about my solution. Thats why I need to learn internet marketing.

This is my plan for 2013. Stay tuned and wish me luck :)
