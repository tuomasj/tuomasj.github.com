title: Gridlover - Build Your Vertical Rhythm 
---
I've been a "shy" fan of typography for a long time. My touching point with typography has been flyers and movie posters. With those I've noticed typography. I've always appreciated how the text works with the images building the communication. 

But thats has been the extent of it. I never dug deeper on typography. I was happy staring at good looking movie posters and choosing fonts on Photoshop without deeper understanding. That was me and typography.

## Digging Deeper ##

Lately, I've been learning typography. I'm not saying my knowledge on typography is deep, but my knowledge of typography is not limited to making fun of Comic Sans MS. And for example, Ville introduced me to the rhythm of text, gave a [link](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb/) to read, and after reading it and surfing the web a bit... I think I understood the vertical rhythm. 

My programmer's brain will translate the whole thing into arrays and patterns. If the pattern is correct, it just happens to make text beautiful. Simple! Since then, I've been applying those patterns into my web sites but still something wasn't quite right. If it's arrays and patterns, it can be automated, right?

## Gridlover ##

[Gridlover](http://http://www.jomppanen.com/tools/gridlover) started as a really simple test, meant for building a simple scale for font sizes. I showed it to Ville and he got excited about it as well! We spent one night building it, working on small bits here and there, and eventually we were happy with it. 

Gridlover builds a scale of font sizes. The scale is based on the base text font size, which you can adjust with a slider. You control the baseline grid height separately, so you have control over both font size and line height.
The scale is calculated by doubling the size of previous step, with applying a scalar factor. It's nifty little app.

[Gridlover](http://www.jomppanen.com/tools/gridlover) was built by [me](http://www.jomppanen.com) and [Ville Vanninen](http://www.pumpula.net).
