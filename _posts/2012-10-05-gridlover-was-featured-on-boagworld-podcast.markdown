Our web typography tool [Gridlover](http://www.gridlover.net) was featured on Boagworld Podcast. 

[Boagworld](http://www.boagworld.com) is a long running podcast about design, development and running web websites. We both have been listening it for years, so we were pretty excited to find out that Paul Boag said really nice things about Gridlover!
